LinuxCIFS utils
The in-kernel CIFS filesystem relies on a set of user-space tools.
That package of tools is called cifs-utils. Although not really part
of Samba proper, these tools were originally part of the Samba package.
For several reasons, shipping these tools as part of Samba was
problematic and it was deemed better to split them off into their own
package.
