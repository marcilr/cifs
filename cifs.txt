Common Internet File System (CIFS)


The Common Internet File System (CIFS) is the standard way that computer
users share files across corporate intranets and the Internet.  An
enhanced version of the Microsoft open, cross-platform Server Message
Block (SMB) protocol, CIFS is a native file-sharing protocol in Windows 2000.

CIFS defines a series of commands used to pass information between networked
computers.  The redirector packages requests meant for remote computers in a
CIFS structure.  CIFS can be sent over a network to remote devices.  The
redirector also uses CIFS to make requests to the protocol stack of the local
computer.  The CIFS messages can be broadly classified as follows:

o Connection establishment messages consist of commands that start and end
  a redirector connection to a shared resource at the server.

o Namespace and File Manipulation messages are used by the redirector to
  gain access to files at the server and to read and write them.

o Printer messages are used by the redirector to send data to a print queue
  at a server and to get status information about the print queue.

o Miscellaneous messages are used by the redirector to write to mailslots
  and named pipes.

Server Message Block
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
In computer networking, Server Message Block (SMB), one version of which
was also known as Common Internet File System operates as an
application-layer network protocol[3] mainly used for providing shared
access to files, printers, and serial ports and miscellaneous communications
between nodes on a network.
